Identity Documentation
======================

.. The following summary is reused in, and needs to be in-sync with, the ../README.md
This Identity library is an authentication/authorization library that:

* Suitable for apps that are targeting end users on
  `Microsoft identity platform <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-overview>`_.
  (which includes Work or school accounts provisioned through Azure AD,
  and Personal Microsoft accounts such as Skype, Xbox, Outlook.com).
* Currently designed for web apps,
  regardless of which Python web framework you are using.
* Provides a set of high level API that is built on top of, and easier to be used than
  `Microsoft's MSAL Python library <https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-python>`_.
* Written in Python, for Python apps.

Scenarios
=========

Web app that logs in users
--------------------------

1. Firstly, create an instance of the :py:class:`.Auth` object,
   and assign it to a (typically global) variable::

    auth = identity.web.Auth(
        session=session,  # A session object is a key-value storage with a
                          # dict-like interface. Many web frameworks provide this.
        authority="https://login.microsoftonline.com/common",
        client_id="your_app_client_id",
        client_credential="your_secret",
        )

2. Now, in your web app's login controller, call the
   ``auth.log_in(scopes=["your_scope"], redirect_uri="https://your_app.example.com/redirect_uri")``
   (see also :py:meth:`.log_in`)
   to obtain the ``auth_uri`` (and possibly a ``user_code``),
   and then render them into your login html page.

3. The second leg of log-in needs to be implemented in another controller,
   which calls ``auth.complete_log_in(incoming_query_parameters)``
   (see also :py:meth:`.complete_log_in`).
   If its returned dict contains an ``error``, then render the error to end user,
   otherwise your end user has successfully logged in,
   and his/her information is available as a dict returned by :meth:`.get_user`.
   In particular, the returned dict contains a key named ``sub``,
   whose value is the unique identifier which you can use to represent this end user
   in your app's local database.

4. Don't forget to add one more controller for log out. You do it by calling
   ``auth.log_out("https://your_app.example.com")``.
   Please refer to :meth:`.log_out`'s docs for more details about its return value.

All of the content above are demonstrated in this sample (link to be provided).


Web app that logs in users and calls a web API on their behalf
--------------------------------------------------------------

Building on top of the previous scenario, you just need to call
``auth.get_token_for_user(["your_scope"])`` to obtain a token object.
See :py:meth:`.get_token_for_user` for more details.
And you can see it in action in this sample (link to be provided).


API
===

The following section is the API Reference of Identity library.

.. note::

    Only APIs and their parameters documented in this section are part of public API,
    with guaranteed backward compatibility for the entire 1.x series.

    Other modules in the source code are all considered as internal helpers,
    which could change at anytime in the future, without prior notice.
